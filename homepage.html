  <h2>"Work Hard In Silence; Let Success Make The Noise"</h2>
    <p> An upcoming global technology leader, looking to become a technical project manager where I can utilize my love for working in teams, communication, and developing a dynamic structure. As someone who is very energetic and personable I want to empower young leaders by leaving a legendary mark on the road to success. I plan to take my leadership globally, create opportunities to urban youth, and be an employer.
          I specialize in business, quality assurance, communications, and project management.  As a highly adaptable communicator and motivator, I’m able to work effectively with diverse management styles and people across all levels of an organization.  </p>

    <p> Born in Seattle, WA and raised in Kent, WA, I have always wanted to create “something”. “Something” was also so vague, but as I got older I added meaning to what that was. “Something” will be in the form of the next tech product to the progression of development, it will be a foundation that will expand globally, it will be mentorship to youth. My “Something” has finally been defined and I am working every day to align my ventures with my goals. I attended Kent-Meridian High school and later went on to attend Green River College. I got an Associate’s degree in Business and have since them continued my education non-tradionally. I found my interest in tech at Year Up. Year Up is a non-profit organization that provides accelerated professional and technical development in one year. While at year up I saw firsthand what support looks like when people are advocating for your success. I was a Student Ambassador and a Quality Assurance tester. Through those opportunities, I gained a wide range of tech tools and development in 6months. After the first six months of the program concluded I joined another technology program and began my internship at BECU as a business support analyst. While balancing both I was an excellent intern by day and a developer by night. I strive to do great things and have the support I need to keep me fueled.  </p>
      <p>My passion wasn’t defined until I got older, but I know I am always wanted to help people. Weather that was in the form of be being a caregiver, a team leader, or a student ambassador I plan to take that passion now to the next level by merging it with my skillset in development and project management.
    When I am not on the job, you can find me spending time with my family, creating new hairstyles, and indulging my love for traveling. One place you’ll always find me is on the front tiers of developing tomorrows future. -Heaven
